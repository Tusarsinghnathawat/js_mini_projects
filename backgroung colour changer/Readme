This is a simple web-based tool that allows users to change the background color of the page and a circle element by clicking 
different color buttons. The first click changes the outer background, and the second click changes the color of the circle

Features: 
Color Changing: Choose from 4 color options (Orange, Green, Yellow, Red) to change the background color.
Interactive: The color of the circle and the background are independently changeable with two clicks.
Responsive Design: The layout is designed to look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

Files :
index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the page.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the layout and buttons.
script.js: The JavaScript file handling the click events for changing the background and circle colors.

How It Works :
The page contains several buttons representing different colors: Orange, Green, Yellow, and Red.
When the user clicks a color button for the first time, it changes the background color of the page.
The second click on the same button changes the background color of the circular div

Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the webpage.
CSS: For styling the page and the layout.
JavaScript: For the interactive functionality of the color change.
